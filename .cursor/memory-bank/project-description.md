# Ant Colony Simulation

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive ant colony simulation built with p5.js. It simulates the behavior of ants as they forage for food, communicate through pheromones, and build their colony.

## Features
- Realistic ant movement and behavior patterns
- Pheromone trail system for ant communication
- Food gathering and colony growth mechanics
- Interactive environment where users can add food sources or obstacles
- Visual representation of pheromone trails and ant activities

## Technical Implementation
- Built with p5.js for rendering and animation
- Object-oriented design with classes for ants, food, pheromones, and the colony
- Physics-based movement with steering behaviors
- Efficient algorithms for pheromone diffusion and evaporation

## User Interaction
- Click to add food sources
- Toggle different visualization modes (pheromones, ant paths, etc.)
- Adjust simulation parameters (ant speed, pheromone strength, etc.)

## Educational Value
This simulation demonstrates emergent behavior, where simple rules followed by individual ants create complex colony-level patterns and intelligence without centralized control.

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple ant species with different behaviors
- Predators and environmental challenges
- Colony wars and territory control
- More detailed ant life cycle (eggs, larvae, etc.)
